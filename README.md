## Registry Overview
HCP Terraform and TFE includes a private registry that is available to all accounts. Unlike the public registry, the private registry can import modules and providers from your private VCS repositories on any of HCP Terraform's supported VCS providers. It also lets you upload and manage private, custom providers through the HCP Terraform API and curate a list of commonly-used public providers and modules.
